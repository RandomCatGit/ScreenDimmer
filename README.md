# ScreenDimmer
Simple application to reduce brightness of your display. No freemium trickery, no cost and simple.

Exe (requires java 1.6 and above) <a href="https://github.com/RandomCatGit/ScreenDimmer/blob/master/brightness/exe/Dimmer.exe?raw=true">Exe Download</a>

Icon file (put this icon in the same folder) <a href="https://github.com/RandomCatGit/ScreenDimmer/blob/master/brightness/exe/dimmer.png?raw=true" download>Dimmer Icon</a>
